            <p>ABOUT</p>
            
            <p>Hi. I'm tệ, the webmastệr at e0x0e0.club. Call me tệ or 147. You're at my folder right now, <code>/~147/</code>. It's my homepage on the internet. Come on in.</p>
                        
            <p>If you like the design, it was inspired by "DiggieDog", a Gopher client on Android. Yes, I browse Gopherspace frequently, but I'm not committed enough to have my own gopherhole. So... I dug myself a webhole right here, in the comfort of HTML.</p>
            
            <p>FAQ</p>
            
            <p>1. License?</p>
            <dd> <code>/~147/</code> is a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/" target="_blank">Public Domain</a> dedication. Everything under <code>/~147/</code> is yours to peruse, no strings attached. <a href="#/program/open-source.xyz">Our source code</a> is also publicly available on Github. </dd>
            <p>2. Is this an ARG?</p>
            <dd>Even though the navigation seems a bit mystery meat, this is not an ARG. It's my personal webpage.</dd>
            <p>3. What is e0x0e0? </p>
            <dd>e0x0e0 is an old pseudonym I had on Instagram, and also on Neocities for a while. Nowadays "e0x0e0" refers not to me but to the website e0x0e0.club. e0x0e0 is us, we are the club. I like to think of e0x0e0 as a collective, even though it's still mostly me and... like, a piece of Ket. But I will get the whole of Ket and some other people on board as well, someday when I'm no longer plagued with reality.

            <p>Some of Judith Nijland's albums are available for free listening on her website(!!!). <a href="https://judithnijland.nl/suitcase-of-songs-2/" target="_blank">Check this out</a>.</p>
            <p>
                Other albums available <a href="https://judithnijland.nl/album/" target="_blank">here</a>, but the one I was looking for (Acoustic Solutions vol. 4) wasn't there. But that's okay, "Suitcase Of Songs" have most of the songs from vol 4. I'm just so glad to find this because most of her recorded discography is on CD and not on streaming platforms.

            <p>23.4.2023</p>
            <p>Sunday evening. It&#39;s already 20:30 but I want to take myself out for a date. All the cafes I like would&#39;ve been closed by now. The only things open at this hours are K-markets (but they&#39;ll stop selling alcohol at 9) and bars/pubs, most of which would be too noisy or crowded for my taste. I decide to take a shower. It will take me another 30 mins to reach the city centre. I wonder what sort of place will open it&#39;s door to shelter me at this hour.</p>
            ---
            <p>I finally got ready at 22:02, another 13 mins waiting at the bus stop. At first I wanted to go to ▒▒▒▒▒▒ &#39;cause I&#39;ve been there once and the vibe was nice. But ▒▒▒▒▒▒ will be closed at 23:00, which means I&#39;ll have less than 30 mins to finish whatever drink I ordered there, and I&#39;m a very slow drinker. I don&#39;t want to crawl to another pub after 23.00, so I decided to check out a new bar called ▓▓▓. It&#39;s a small place (I have a bias for small spaces), it&#39;ll close at 00:00, and according to Google Maps it&#39;s less crowded than usual. So I thought it&#39;d be suitable for today.</p>
            <p>As I gaze through the road of ▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒ while on the bus, I also saw some other main-road bigger bars like ▒▒ and the ▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒ ▒▒▒▒▒... which I know will be open until 2-5 AM, but I still wanted to wait and go to ▓▓▓. I realized that I have a clear preference when it comes to bars &amp; pubs: I find bars that are too fancy rather off-putting. You know, those bougie jazz-pubs-slash-social-clubs that have a huge ass terrace, perfectly aligned diner tables, velvety seats, shimmery gold to be the main color of their palette... Deluxe rooftop sky bars that are entitled enough to reject your RP card and ask for a passport (yes I do hold a grudge). Those with a tuxed man in their logo, that are designed like a first-class suite on the Titanic and reek the smell of old money... irk me to no end. I also don&#39;t like bars that are too square and flat and symmetrical, or too conveniently planned. The Finnish landscape is full of hills and slopes and extruding bedrock, it&#39;s very uneven and most roads are steep as a ski track. This tricky geography enables different types of building to exist, including the extra-small, the underground, and the asymmetrical. Whenever I see a spatial building that lays on a flat road, I feel like they&#39;re having it too easy (or they apparently won the real estate lottery). I like buildings that adapt to the space available for them, be it tucked into a sharp street-corner or shoved under the basement of an apartment complex, the smaller the space the more innovative people gets. Design-wise, I also like bars that look a bit rustic (wood furniture is a big win), mismatchy, or New York street rat DIY-Punk vibe. Of course, I&#39;m not that picky when I go out with others, but when I go by myself, I do like very <em>specific</em> things.</p>
            <p>Turns out, I made the right decision going to ▓▓▓ instead of the main-street bars. The place is a fucking jackpot (imo). First off, it&#39;s pretty niche and tucked away from the noisy part of the city centre. Nobody even asked for my ID, which makes me so damn happy cause I&#39;m asian and you know how asian people have to prove their age everywhere - I guess it&#39;s the combination of them not having a lot of customers and me showing up in this esosteric location alone at 22:35 that makes them think I can&#39;t possibly be a minor. Anyways, this fucking place, I feel happy just looking at it. It&#39;s small and cozy and is divided into multiple micro-areas (despite being small), each of which have one or two crooked corners, but they made it work. The wall was painted (in a very amateur manner) deep red and adorned with pictureless picture frames. Many decor elements seemed like they were DIY-ed out of refurbished materials, like the light fixtures and the bar itself. Furnitures look like the kind mass-produced in the 70s-80s, all mismatched, some of them have visible tears as if they&#39;ve been hauled straight from a flea market. The composition was fucking beautiful, makes it seem like a beat-down old living room. Overall it looks very fleshed-out, vintage but not in a pretentious way.</p>
            <p>That was long. So here&#39;s a quick conclusion to wrap it up before I get too drunk to write the rest of this entry: 10/10 would visit again. It was a vibe, some dude is singing along to Gloria Gaynor&#39;s &quot;I Will Survive&quot;. I&#39;m so glad that I chose to go here. It&#39;s already 23:22 (crazy), only half an hour until closing time, so I better hurry. </p>
            ---
            <p>I wish to have Jo Franco&#39;s mindset. &quot;Somebody I meet in this city is going to change my life - I just don&#39;t know who it is yet.&quot; It&#39;s a highly romanticized and hopeful line of thought, yeah, but I think I&#39;d be much easier on people if I think about it like that. I do like to pretend that I&#39;m a solo traveler privileged enough to go on a trip for self-discovery and reflection, having late night dates with their journal at a bar sitting in a corner writing their heart out, instead of... a busy student doing the smallest bit of selfcare and feeling guilty about wasting money.

            <p>It&#39;s march. The word for march in finnish is maaliskuu, it means &quot;the month where you could see the ground&quot;, i.e when snow is supposed to melt. I&#39;m not seeing no ground, everything is covered in even thicker snow than we had in febuary. But we&#39;re having more sun now and day is getting longer so summer is definitely coming (cheers in -10°C).</p>
            <p>I rearrange all the furnitures in my room bi-monthly bc I get bored of coherence and routine. School is not doing well rn (though, it has to be well bc I need a scholarship). I figured that I&#39;m totally capable of doing the work and I could pass the courses if only I do attend classes/pay attention, but I don&#39;t. Maybe I can partly blame it on the fact that I don&#39;t have friends (as in sb to regularly talk / have lunch with) at school, which has bothered me more than I think it would. But mostly I&#39;m just understimulated, by lectures and people and all their beautiful outlook on the future. Yiddi yadda we&#39;re all gonna die in the following years and all that matters is what we do in the small moments we have before death, and I start to feel like I don&#39;t wanna waste time in this stupid degree.</p>
            <p>Any sort of human contact I&#39;ve made during my time in finland have been functional, practical, and site-specific. Sometimes I think these constraints keep me a part of society but sometimes I think they make me hungry for something else. I think that&#39;s why I&#39;m still making content for the web. </p>

                <p style="margin: 1em">Artists: use the ideas of other artists, this is anti-capitalist. The borrowing of ideas is the basis of creativity. Turn to the art directions of yesterday! In art, we often see the ideas of the past presented as new, which corresponds to the principles of the capitalist economy — the economy of planned obsolescence. We urge you not to chase imaginary novelty! Reuse ideas, concepts and forms created in the past, honestly and boldly.</p>

            <p>31.1.23 ~ 22:57</p>
            <p>Done with school, did the laundry again (it went well), had dinner (rye bread, edam cheese, lingonberries jam, some mandarines), talked to Ket a little, watched two episodes of Karen Pirie (terrible romance, but I&#39;m following the case).</p>
            <p>All is well. Except nothing is. Still have to make up for the last missed assignments. Still have to find someone for the interview. I&#39;m really testing ░░░░░░░░&#39;s patience with my AutoCAD project, I&#39;m considering offering video tutorials or sth like that in return for his ever-so-forgiving attitude. Maybe I could help with teaching SketchUp, he seems pretty miserable, having to take the lot.</p>
            <p>Anw. I&#39;m starting the Web3 masterclass right now. Quick overview: I do love the way they present this, the wackiness (&quot;chief troublemaker&quot;, &quot;A statement male to save one&#39;s own ass&quot;). These people seem pretty punk themselves and the way they present Web3 makes me feel like I&#39;m witnessing Tim Berners-Lee introducing the World Wide Web in 1995 at Havard. Even though I&#39;m coming in with all the precaution and skepticism, I know the nerd side of me would want to see all the wonderful (or horrifying) applications it may have in the future.</p>
            <p>0.1 • &quot;We&#39;ll leave out the hype and let you decide&quot; Well thank G*d. I&#39;ll take everything with a grain of salt. I guess you can consider these &quot;Lecture notes&quot;.</p>
            <p>1.1 • Oh fuck me they created a fashion playground in the Metaverse man not the fucking Metaverse. My thoughts rn is that they&#39;re creating social-media-on-steroid and not investigating the behavioral effects it can have.</p>
            <p>1.1 • &quot;In order to create a model of digital fashion that can be traded, we have to have blockchain as an enabling technology&quot; - That&#39;s an interesting statement. The previous one said that in order to be decentralized we need blockchain, but I know this isn&#39;t true. BitTorrent and IPFS exist, many other distributed technologies exist. I think it&#39;s just that blockchain tech facilitates the &quot;trade&quot; part - since so many currencies emerged from it that made people and businesses favor it more.</p>
            <p>1.1 • Differences between Web 1, 2 &amp; 3 - Good point. Web2 didn&#39;t replace Web1 but was built on top of it. Same goes for Web3. Well. Actually, if you&#39;re talking abt semantics, Web2 didn&#39;t remove Web1 sure, but it replaced Web1 in the mind of most people. It became essential, the new normal for mass public except for ppl like us NIMBYs, Luddites, Neocitizens who insist to do things the way it was done in the 90s. I&#39;m thinking of all the waste this could generate. All this talk abt Web3 being omnipotent gives me real suspicions, it&#39;s like inventing plastics in the 1860s and using them for everything and when the problem - waste - was spotted, it was already too late and the world depends on plastic. I wonder what would be a now-trivial issue caused by Web3 that will become threatening in the future. How do we disaster-proof this stuff? Right now ppl are using it for crazy ideas - virtual fashion, very cute - but somebody gotta research the downside of this, no?</p>
            <p>1.1 • &quot;We&#39;ll introduce VR headsets&quot; and you claim to be sustainable ??? To be planet friendly? With more devices and more mining?</p>
            <p>1.1 • &quot;We&#39;re gonna move from being just consumers where our values is extracted to actually being able to participate in the economy&quot; How?? I have questions. But like... A space where people don&#39;t just consume content but also create or sell their own content...that&#39;s the Web.</p>
            <p>... Or at least that was the Web, before the dot-com boom. Before someone made a private &amp; centralized version of it that&#39;s so simple it could be used by a 10-year-old and non-tech people flocked to that. You think those people care abt the fact that the Web is intended to be free and open and not privately owned by 5 white guys? THEY gave up privacy for convenience. I&#39;m guessing that one day someone will get the brilliant idea of providing Web3 services for ppl who don&#39;t want to know how it works, and those services will exploit the users, and then Web3 will become extremely popular - at the cost of its core value. What about that?</p>
            <p>1.1 • &quot;Creare wealth together&quot; wealth is nоt аbоut having/producing/ creating more, it&#39;s about distributing the right resource to the right place, and the total amount of resource doesn&#39;t change. &quot;Creating wealth&quot; isn&#39;t about growth and innovation, it&#39;s more like a giant mass balance problem.</p>
            <p>-- that&#39;s it for today. I gotta take a break, my laptop fan is spinning for dear life.</p>

            <p>Sitting next to the piano room of ▒▒▒▒▒▒▒▒ library again. Something about live music that is very soothing even though it&#39;s from another room. If I could, I&#39;d live next to a conservatory to hear people practice every day... But I shouldn&#39;t be thinking about that. The pianist (I assume) played the simple warm-up that I once knew, a couple of times at different speeds, then went on with Bach&#39;s WTC first prelude, Debussy&#39;s Arabesque 1, and Pachelbel&#39;s Canon in D. Even though they&#39;re all quite popular pieces - dead horses beaten to pulp - I still enjoy them greatly. You know the player is good when it&#39;s Canon in D and I ain&#39;t complaining...</p>
            <p>Anywho, moment of truth. (I feel like I&#39;m treating my journal like a confession booth in a church or sth where I go to confide and confess my sins. After all if I can&#39;t be honest with anyone else I&#39;d still try and be honest with myself). Went to school today, but I didn&#39;t go to classes. I didn&#39;t want to meet anyone but I saw ░░░░ (hope she didn&#39;t see me) and I saw ░░░░░ twice (he saw me). I arrived super late bc I freaked out about my hair and decided to take a shower, but then I forgot to brush my teeth and so even though I was chewing xylitol gum all along the way to school, I am self-conscious.</p>
            <p>I think about ░░░░░, about how I&#39;d be much more motivated to go to school if she was there in my class. I think about learning chess so that I have an excuse to come over and hang with her.

            <p>I didn&#39;t do a good job joining a group in class, though I didn&#39;t think much of it. I&#39;ve failed to join groups in pretty much every school I went to, unless I mask myself extensively or the group is tolerant of weird people. Anywho, I think the 21▖▖▖▖▖ could be grouped into 4 main cliques: the boys, the girls, the Finns, and the neckbeards. The Finns have an impermeable language border around their territory, so I&#39;ve stopped trying to get to them, until I sorted out my finnish at least. The boys... do pretty much everything together, they would let me hang with them if I asked, but I just can&#39;t quite catch their jokes. I can talk with the girls fine, but only about schoolwork bc I don&#39;t care about malls, parties, or &quot;Who&#39;s dating who&quot; kinda gossip. I ended up hanging out mostly with the neckbeards, they&#39;re all guys, older than me, and super &#39;lax. I can&#39;t say I&#39;m close to them in a dudebro way but at least I never feel left out by the neckbeards. The only downside is that they don&#39;t attend class that often cuz they all have a life. </p>
            <p>And then there are "the others", aka those who have some crippled school year: ░░░░░ who is half-20▖▖▖▖▖, ░░░ who transferred from ▒▒▒▒▒▒▒ in the 2nd year, ░░░░░░ who is half-22▖▖▖▖▖, and ░░░░░░░ who I think also transferred in when we&#39;re already halfway through 2nd year. They&#39;re all kinda out of place and end up trying in frustration to integrate into one of the groups (except ░░░░░ I guess? Since he could hang out with the 20▖▖▖▖▖s). But &quot;The others&quot; aren&#39;t a clique, they&#39;re scattered everywhere just like me.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, there&#39;s also a new group joining us for some courses this spring: the exchange students. I&#39;m beginning to see segregation, but it&#39;s fine, they&#39;re still super green and not close to each other. This is a good time to fetch some single-serving friends for the next 4 months, I&#39;m already getting along with some of the girls: ░░░░░░░░, ░░░░░░, ░░░░, and also a guy named ░░░░░ who&#39;s super soft-spoken. (Now that I think abt it, it&#39;s quite stupid to skip this morning&#39;s lecture).</p>
            <p>It&#39;s already the end of Jan, it&#39;s unbelievable. I gotta pay the ▖▖▖▖ insurance fee real quick, and I&#39;ll have the Wеb3 master class tomorrow too. So I gotta prepare for that, on top of doing all my missing homework and doing laundry. What a trip. Deadline for interviewee confirmation is tomorrow, gotta ask ░░░░░░░░, ░░░░░ and the Ruohonjuuri shop today. I&#39;m gonna get some groceries from Lidl now, I hope all the work will get me back on track, manga is really making me stray from my engineering goal.</p>

            <p>6.10.2021. It doesn't get realer than this.</p>
            <blockquote>
                <p style="margin: 1em">Woke up thinking about socmed is going down and everyone are freaking out about it because we depend on them to connect with loved ones and/or showing off ourselves as a form of self-expression and without them we're lost and lonely and pathetic - exactly how they wanted us to. Anyways I've already had this talk with mink tệ (who's stopped using socmeds) like months ago and we talked about how people used to have their own homepage/website where we control everything about it and we choose what to do with our sites and what to put out there without the need to constantly be checking up / engage in trends or social activities because there is none its like an online portfolio/diary and we can also choose whether or not we put up a message box for friends and people who r interested in talking to us can send messages/asks/mails and its kinda like a penpal system. <mark>Back in the days when the internet was just a tool for us not the thing that shaped our entire lifestyle. Back when using the internet is no different than taking up a hobby not our entire societal bone structure.</mark> Anyways what I'm getting out of this is it's weird that we knew this would happen and it did, and people are reacting exactly how these socmed corps wanted us to: to be afraid of losing friends, losing income, losing followers, losing memories and even losing identities, that <mark>when one site is down we hurrily flock into another</mark>, jumping from one socmeds to the other, but none of us is ready to let it go, to stop using them, because our lives depend on them. Which is fucked up. What I'm getting at is that it is now 10:30am in the morning and I need to get breakfast, <mark>and I could do that without broadcasting what I'm thinking about to the entire world, using a system I know I'm now a slave to and I know its making money out of me based on the attention I give it,</mark> but here I am anyways, and here is my thought regardless.</p>

I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. We have all at one time or another mixed some mud. Just use the old one inch brush. Use what you see, don't plan it. Let your imagination be your guide. See there, told you that would be easy. Let's make some happy little clouds in our world. Learn when to stop.</p>

                                    <p>These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. You need to have a very firm paint to do this. Absolutely no pressure. You are just a whisper floating across a mountain. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. And right there you got an almighty cloud. You don't have to be crazy to do this but it does help. Son of a gun. We don't have anything but happy trees here. This present moment is perfect simply due to the fact you're experiencing it. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. Everyone wants to enjoy the good parts - but you have to build the framework first. The shadows are just like the highlights, but we're going in the opposite direction.</p>

                                    <p>Trees cover up a multitude of sins. Only think about one thing at a time. Don't get greedy. Let's build an almighty mountain. The man who does the best job is the one who is happy at his job. It's cold, but it's beautiful. You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Just go out and talk to a tree. Make friends with it. This is probably the greatest thing that's ever happened in my life.</p>

                                    <p>Working it up and down, back and forth. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. A tree cannot be straight if it has a crooked trunk. Let's put some happy little clouds in our world. If you've been in Alaska less than a year you're a Cheechako. We can fix anything. Clouds are free. They just float around the sky all day and have fun. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. Every day I learn. We can always carry this a step further. There's really no end to this. Everybody's different. Trees are different. Let them all be individuals.</p>

                                </div>
                                <input type="radio" name="img-1" title="fifth happy tab">

                                    <p>We artists are a different breed of people. We're a happy bunch. Don't forget to tell these special people in your life just how special they are to you. There comes a nice little fluffer. All you have to learn here is how to have fun. See there, told you that would be easy. You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Don't kill all your dark areas - you need them to show the light. These little son of a guns hide in your brush and you just have to push them out. In your imagination you can go anywhere you want. Even the worst thing we can do here is good. Let's put some happy trees and bushes back in here. For the lack of a better word I call them hangy downs. See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. I will take some magic white, and a little bit of Vandyke brown and a little touch of yellow.</p>

                                    <p>We have a fantastic little sky! Anytime you learn something your time and energy are not wasted. How to paint. That's easy. What to paint. That's much harder. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. Just use the old one inch brush. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. Everybody needs a friend.</p>
